## What is Dead Air Project?

**Dead Air Project** is an archive of ghostbox recordings, EVP sessions, and anomalous audio experiments.

The goal is not to prove or claim anything —  
but to **document**, **archive**, and **let the listener decide**.

All audio is presented as transparently as possible:
- raw recordings
- enhanced references (clearly marked)
- no hidden processing
- no sensational framing

---

## Methodology

Sessions may include:
- ghostbox radio sweep
- controlled silence recordings
- environmental audio capture

Each session documents:
- location
- equipment
- notable audio segments (markers)
- confidence level (low / medium / high)

---

## Transparency & Ethics

> **Important**  
> Enhanced audio is provided for reference only.  
> No content is added. Processing may introduce artefacts.

Dead Air Project does not claim voices, entities, or communication.  
Markers represent **listener interpretation**, not conclusions.

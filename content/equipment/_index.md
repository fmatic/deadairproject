- Usage: selective sessions
- Notes:
  - Sweep rate unchanged during sessions
  - Audio captured externally when possible

### Røde VideoMic Me-L
- Function: external microphone for mobile recording
- Used with: iPhone
- Purpose:
  - improved signal clarity
  - reduced handling noise

### iPhone (Voice Memos)
- Function: raw session recording
- Format: uncompressed / default app settings
- Role: primary capture device in some sessions

### Olympus VN-8000PC
- Function: digital voice recorder
- Usage: EVP-focused recordings
- Notes:
  - internal microphone
  - minimal onboard processing

### Tascam DR-05
- Function: digital voice recorder
- Usage: EVP-focused recordings
- Notes:
  - Omni-directional condenser microphones
  - sensitivity up to 125dB SPL

## External Speakers

### JBL Micro Wireless
- Old-fashioned, flat and narrow sound profile
- Limited frequency response (no deep bass, no sparkle)
- Bad for music playback
- Excellent for Ghost Box / Spirit Box use
- Speech and noise artifacts come through clearly
- Small, simple, no sound “enhancement” or processing
- Does not mask EVP-type anomalies
- Powered speaker – practical for field use

## Procaster OZC-01
- Flat, uncolored and slightly muffled sound
- Very limited frequency response
- Not too much audio processing, quite heavy bass
- Well-suited for Ghost Box / Spirit Box output
- Speech fragments and noise artifacts stand out clearly
- Minimal sound processing or enhancement
- Does not smooth or mask potential EVP content
- Simple, utilitarian speaker behavior benefits analysis

## JBL Go (1st. Generation)
- Boxy, sharp-edged and mid-focused sound profile
- Narrow bandwidth with almost no low-end
- Highly effective for Ghost Box / Spirit Box use
- Digital noise, syllables and transient sounds are clearly exposed
- Early-generation design with minimal DSP influence
- Does not beautify or compress audio artifacts
- Compact and practical external speaker for field work

## Measurement equipment

### ST1393 EMF Smart Sensor Meter
- Function: electromagnetic field measurement
- Usage:
  - environmental reference
  - anomaly correlation
- Notes:
  - readings logged but not interpreted as causal
- Dual Testing Functions (detect and measure the  electric field radiation and magnetic field emission)
- Range: 20Hz~300Hz magnetic field and 20Hz~3500MHz electric field
- Temperature Measurement
- Audible and Visual Dual Alarm

## Audio processing tools

All processing is performed **after recording**, never live.

### iPad-based tools
- **WavePad**
- **Ferrite**
- **TwistedWave**
- **Brusfri**

Processing may include:
- gain adjustment
- EQ
- noise reduction (reference only)

Raw audio is always preserved and prioritized.

### Windows-based tools

 - **SonicVisualiser** Mainly for large EVP-session analyzation
 - **Audacity**

## Session references

Individual session pages may reference this log using:
- specific devices
- recording chains
- processing steps

This allows each session to be reviewed in context.

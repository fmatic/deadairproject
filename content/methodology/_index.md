> ### TL;DR
> Dead Air Project documents anomalous audio using a **documentation-first approach**.
>  
> - Raw audio is always preserved and presented first  
> - Enhanced audio is provided only as a listening aid  
> - EVP markers reflect **perceived sounds**, not conclusions  
> - Confidence levels describe **clarity**, not origin  
>  
> Readers are encouraged to listen critically and draw their own conclusions.


## 🧪 Methodology

### Purpose

Dead Air Project follows a **documentation-first approach**.

The purpose of this project is not to validate beliefs or disprove skepticism, but to create a **transparent, repeatable framework** for recording, reviewing, and archiving anomalous audio.

No assumptions are made about the origin of recorded sounds.

> The value of the project lies in documentation, not persuasion.

## 🧭 Session Structure

Each session follows a loosely standardized structure to ensure consistency while allowing flexibility.

### Environment
- Location is noted  
- Time of day is recorded  
- Ambient conditions are observed (silence, background noise, nearby electronics)

### Recording
- Raw audio is captured using one or more devices  
- No live filtering or processing is applied during recording  
- Sessions may include controlled silence periods

### Ghostbox / ITC (when used)
- Radio sweep rate and method are not modified mid-session  
- No real-time interpretation is spoken during recording  
- Questions, if asked, are neutral and non-leading

## 🎧 Audio Handling

### Raw Recordings

Raw audio is preserved in its original form and always presented first.

Raw recordings represent the **primary source material** and should be considered authoritative.

### Enhanced Reference Audio

Enhanced versions may be created for reference listening using:
- gain adjustment  
- equalization  
- noise reduction

No content is added, synthesized, rearranged, or re-sequenced.

Enhanced audio exists solely as a **listening aid** and may introduce artefacts.  
For this reason, raw audio should always be treated as the primary source.

## 🔖 EVP Markers & Interpretation

Markers are placed at timestamps where the listener perceives:
- voice-like elements  
- anomalous sounds  
- responses following prompts

Each marker includes:
- **Type** (whisper / response / noise)  
- **Confidence level** (low / medium / high)

These labels reflect **subjective perception**, not conclusions.

Different listeners may hear different things — or nothing at all.

---

## 📊 Confidence Levels

Each identified EVP is assigned a confidence level based on **clarity and repeatability**, not interpretation or assumed origin.

### Low confidence
- Weak, brief, or ambiguous sound  
- Easily confused with noise or artefacts  
- Requires focused listening or enhancement

### Medium confidence
- Clearer sound resembling speech or response  
- Audible without extreme processing  
- Repeatable across multiple listens

### High confidence
- Distinct word or short phrase  
- Contextually relevant to the question  
- Clearly audible without heavy enhancement

> Confidence ratings are subjective but applied consistently to support transparent analysis.

## 📄 Documentation & Transparency

- No sessions are edited to support a narrative  
- No markers are added retroactively without disclosure  
- Equipment and settings are documented  
- Raw and enhanced audio are clearly separated

All data is presented so that **independent interpretation is possible**.

Session marker data is compiled into an EVP table and can be exported for external review.

## ⚠️ Limitations

Dead Air Project acknowledges several inherent limitations, including:
- human pattern recognition bias  
- artefacts introduced by audio processing  
- environmental interference  
- radio frequency bleed-through

These limitations are documented openly and are considered part of the observation process.

## 🌐 Technical Note

Audio files are hosted on a separate media domain.  
Some corporate or restricted networks may block direct media access.

## 🧠 Closing Statement

> Methodology does not reveal truth —  
> it only defines how observations are made.

Dead Air Project exists to document, not to convince.

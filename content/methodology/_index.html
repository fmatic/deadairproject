## Purpose

Dead Air Project follows a **documentation-first** approach.

The goal is not to validate beliefs or disprove skepticism, but to create a transparent, repeatable framework for recording, reviewing, and archiving anomalous audio.

No assumptions are made about the origin of recorded sounds.

---

## Session structure

Each session follows a loosely standardized structure to ensure consistency:

1. **Environment**
   - Location is noted
   - Time of day is recorded
   - Ambient conditions are observed (silence, background noise, electronics)

2. **Recording**
   - Raw audio is captured using one or more devices
   - No live filtering or processing during recording
   - Sessions may include controlled silence periods

3. **Ghostbox / ITC (when used)**
   - Radio sweep rate and method are not modified mid-session
   - No real-time interpretation is spoken during recording
   - Questions, if asked, are neutral and non-leading

## Audio handling

### Raw recordings
Raw audio is preserved in its original form and always presented first.

Raw recordings represent the primary source material.

### Enhanced reference audio
Enhanced versions may be created using:
- gain adjustment
- equalization
- noise reduction

No content is added or synthesized.

Enhanced audio exists solely as a **listening aid** and may introduce artefacts.  
For this reason, raw audio should always be considered the authoritative source.

## EVP markers & interpretation

Markers are placed at timestamps where the listener perceives:
- voice-like elements
- anomalous sounds
- responses following prompts

Markers include:
- **Type** (whisper / response / noise)
- **Confidence level** (low / medium / high)

These labels reflect **subjective perception**, not conclusions.

Different listeners may hear different things — or nothing at all.

---

## Transparency

- No sessions are edited to support a narrative
- No markers are added retroactively without disclosure
- Equipment and settings are documented

Data is presented so that **independent interpretation is possible**.

---

## Limitations

Dead Air Project acknowledges several inherent limitations:
- human pattern recognition bias
- audio artefacts caused by processing
- environmental interference
- radio frequency bleed-through

These limitations are part of the documentation, not something to be hidden.

Note: Audio files are hosted on a separate media domain.
Some corporate or restricted networks may block direct media access.

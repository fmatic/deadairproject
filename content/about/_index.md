title: "About 🧩"
---



My name is **Janne**.

I was born in 1975 and live in Central Finland.  
By profession, I work as a **practical nurse**, primarily in elderly care.

Questions surrounding death, what comes after it, and the unknown aspects of human experience have always been close to me. Through my work, death is not an abstract concept — it is something I encounter as a natural part of everyday life. Alongside this, I have witnessed moments and experiences that do not always fit neatly into purely clinical explanations.

I do not claim answers.  
I do not claim proof.

But I also believe that we cannot scientifically *fully* dismiss the possibility that something exists beyond what we currently understand.

## Background & approach

Alongside my professional life, I am a long-time **radio and audio technology enthusiast**. Technical systems, signal processing, and recording equipment have always fascinated me — especially where noise, interference, and unintended signals emerge.

Dead Air Project exists at the intersection of these two worlds:

- lived experience with death and end-of-life care  
- technical curiosity about sound, signal, and noise  
- cautious interest in instrumental transcommunication (ITC)

This project is **not about belief**, and it is not about convincing anyone of anything.  
It is about **documenting**, **archiving**, and **listening carefully**.

All interpretations presented on this site are subjective.  
Markers, labels, and confidence levels reflect perception — not conclusions.

## Ethics & transparency

Dead Air Project does not claim communication, spirits, or entities.  
It documents sound.

- listen critically
- question interpretations
- draw their own conclusions

Raw recordings are always prioritized.  
Enhanced versions are clearly labeled and optional.
